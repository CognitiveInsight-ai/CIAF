## [0.4.0] - 2024-12-19 - CIAF Framework Launch

### üéâ Major Framework Evolution
- **Complete architectural transformation** from monolithic ZKETF to modular CIAF (Cognitive Insight AI Framework)
- **29,361x performance improvement** through lazy capsule materialization
- **Modular design** with clean separation of concerns across six core modules

### Added
- **üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture:**
  - `ciaf.core`: Cryptographic utilities, key management, and Merkle trees
  - `ciaf.anchoring`: Dataset anchoring with lazy materialization
  - `ciaf.provenance`: Provenance capsules, training snapshots, and model aggregation keys
  - `ciaf.inference`: Inference receipts and ZKE chains
  - `ciaf.simulation`: ML framework and LLM simulation
  - `ciaf.wrappers`: Drop-in model wrapper for existing ML workflows
  - `ciaf.api`: Main framework orchestration

- **‚ö° Performance Optimizations:**
  - Lazy capsule materialization (0.006s vs 179s for 1000 items)
  - Dataset-level key derivation for improved security
  - Efficient memory management and resource utilization

- **üîê Enhanced Security:**
  - Improved key derivation with PBKDF2 and HMAC
  - Enhanced cryptographic primitives with AES-GCM
  - Robust hash-based integrity verification

- **üß† ML Integration:**

- **Improved documentation** with detailed architecture guides
- **Better error handling** and validation throughout the framework

### Changed
- **Package rename**: `zketf` ‚Üí `ciaf` reflecting the modular architecture
- **Import structure**: New modular imports from `ciaf.*` modules
- **Class naming**: Updated to reflect CIAF branding and improved clarity
- **Configuration**: Updated `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` for CIAF distribution

### Developer Experience
