## 🔄 In Progress / Needs Attention

### 1. Test Application Directory
- ⚠️ `Test/` directory rename failed due to access restrictions
- 📝 TODO: Manually rename or resolve access issues
- 🎯 Target: Rename to `test_app/` or `demo_app/` for clarity

### 2. Metadata Directories Consolidation
- ⚠️ Multiple metadata directories exist: `ciaf_metadata/`, `ciaf_metadata_demo/`
- 📝 TODO: Consolidate or clearly differentiate purposes
- 🎯 Target: Single metadata storage location with clear organization

### 3. Build Artifacts Cleanup
- ⚠️ `.egg-info/` and `__pycache__/` directories still present
- 📝 TODO: Update .gitignore and clean existing artifacts
- 🎯 Target: Clean repository without build artifacts

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Refinement and Integration
1. **High Priority**:
   - [ ] Resolve Test directory rename issue
   - [ ] Consolidate metadata storage directories
   - [ ] Update .gitignore to handle build artifacts
   - [ ] Create pytest configuration (conftest.py)

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - [ ] Set up Sphinx documentation system
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
   - [ ] Add more industry-specific examples
   - [ ] Create deployment configuration templates

3. **Low Priority**:
   - [ ] Create pre-commit hooks configuration
   - [ ] Add code quality tools configuration
   - [ ] Create Docker configuration
   - [ ] Set up automated documentation building

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. [ ] Create Jupyter notebook examples
2. [ ] Set up performance benchmarking tools
3. [ ] Create deployment automation
4. [ ] Add advanced visualization tools
